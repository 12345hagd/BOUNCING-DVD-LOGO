## Retro DVD screensaver ðŸ“€

The bouncing DVD logo was introduced by the international organization DVD Forum and DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation, a Tokyo-based international company established in the year 2000 with the purpose of standardizing the DVD format.

While this bouncing logo could be found in any home with a DVD player, it gained notoriety when it became the subject of a popular cold open on the American mockumentary sitcom TV series, *The Office*, episode "Launch Party".

After re-watching the series for the 3rd time, probably, I decided to recreate this piece of pop culture classic as my first JavaScript project.
